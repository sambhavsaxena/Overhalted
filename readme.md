The Monospace is a minimalistic blog web app, which can be used for wide range of purposes including keeping secrets.
Because of its privacy-related liberations, we keep the user information encrypted. The app has been developed on MERN stack, and can be easily integrated 

For privacy policy, visit [this link](https://policiesofmonospace.netlify.app/).

* **Why this:** Can be used to store literally anything in text format, including notes, articles, stories and more.
* **SHA-256 encrytped:** The content you post here will always be private, and will stay in encrypted form, using SHA-256 encryption algorithm. 
* **Store anything, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about anyone or anything, it simply is a waste of time and resources as we don't look to sell user data in order to gain huge amount of money, what many multinational organizations do openly, ruling the web.

## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Fork and git clone [this](https://github.com/sambhavsaxena/TheMonospace-CloudBased) repository make an instant copy of the content.
* Alternatively, you can download the source and set it up with Github Desktop.
* Open the root folder in the code editor you prefer, and run the following commands:
```
1) npm install
2) cd ./frontend/ && npm i
3) cd.. && npm run dev(Already configured in [package.json](https://github.com/sambhavsaxena/TheMonospace-CloudBased/blob/main/package.json).
```
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/).  

Check out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)
* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

```jsx
function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.
