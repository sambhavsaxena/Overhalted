The Monospace is a minimalistic blog web app, which can be used for wide range of purposes including keeping secrets.
Because of its privacy-related liberations, we keep the user information encrypted. 

For privacy policy, visit [this link](https://policiesofmonospace.netlify.app/).

* **Why this:** Can be used to store literally anything in text format, including notes, articles, stories and more.
* **Save every bit of content you type:** A `save as pdf` feature has been added with the latest release which allows users to save their content as PDFs.
* **Share notes with a public link:** After you've done editing your content, you can now share it with a single click. A public link will be created within moments.
* **Encrypted pdfs:** The downloaded pdf is text secured, which makes it almost impossible for the text to be copied by anyone.
* **Clean UI:** Visit the web app once, you're gonna love it <3.
* **Store anything, write anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about anyone or anything, it simply is a waste of time and resources as we don't look to sell user data in order to gain huge amount of money, what many multinational organizations do openly, ruling the web.
